OVERVIEW
Project - I was to build an equalizer landing page with the use of HTML and CSS.

Project Objective - This project was aimed at biulding an equalizer landing page using html and css and to make it look similar to what was in the Figma design file.

Useful Links - I was tasked to use github to create a public repository to keep my project files and use either netlify, github pages or vercel to deploy it. I therefore
used github for the repository and vercel for my deployment.


METHODOLOGY
Application Used in Building the Project: I used Visual Studio Code for the coding process, Github Desktop Application for commiting and pushing my commits to my github account and Google Chrome and Firefox for viewing the webpage.

What i learned - The project has really has really broadened my knowledge in frontend web development. When i started with the project, i had to look through the project to note down the necessary elements stated in the project outline which includes the font family, font sizes and colours etc., I then had to write a well structured HTML to help me find it easy when i start applying the CSS. I did a lot of research from different websites which includes freecodecamp, w3schools, youtube etc.
It was obvious that whatever i learnt during my training session on freecodecamp was essential in the building of this project. I enjoyed building of the project though i faced a lot of challenges and this has helped me to get insight about a lot of things in HTML and CSS. I would like to thank my mentor, Ms. Lisa-Marie Koomson for his swift and detailed solutions to my problems whenever i contacted her when i encounter a challenge.
